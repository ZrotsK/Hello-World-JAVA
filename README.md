Verify if you have the recent jdk installed.
Create a file like "HelloWorld" with the extension ".java"
Copy and paste the code in your project.
Open the terminal on the same folder as the file and run the following codes:

(javac HelloWorld.java

java HelloWorld)

And then you have "Hello, World!" printed on your terminal!

Congratulations! xd
